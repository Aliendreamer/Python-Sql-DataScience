delving in data science and dbs

Well as my interests expanded I delved in data science and Dbs. so basicly in sql folder are some things I did with Mysql. The two files
in main directory are my data science final project and another side project of mine.
The black folder keeps the jupyter notebooks I used to try my code and our home assignments over the length of the course.
Image and output contains some  screenshots from the course work and some image files we used in some of the lectures.
Exam folder contains the datasets we were given to work with for our assignment. The only dataset missing used in the notebooks is 
the one used in spatial data notebook as it is 150mb and github has 100mb upper bondary for uploaded files.
Why i uploaded all this? Because I really like data science and plan to delve even further in when I have the time.And because when I 
start looking for work in the field I can show people that I know something.And i am well aware I have so much more to learn.
