delving in data science and dbs

Well as my interests expanded I delved in data science and Dbs. so basicly in sql folder are some things I did with Mysql. The two files
in main directory are my data science final project and another side project of mine.
The black folder keeps the jupyter notebooks I used to try my code and our home assignments over the length of the course.
Image and output contains some  screenshots from the course work and some image files we used in some of the lectures.
